Comlab Complaints Logger Management Module
==========================================

In an effort to improve service levels, Commerce Labs Evaluator is a logging utility that allows for the capturing of authenticated students' complaints over a period of time. Complaints are sorted into defined Types and Sub Types which are set up through the Management Module application. Comlab Complaints Logger is a simple SQL Server driven application that interfaces with the local UCT LDAP server for student authentication.

Built on the same shell as Commerce Labs Evaluator, Comlab Complaints Logger Management Module is a essential extension that allows the system administrator to make crucial updates to the database to ensure the original application's extensibility as well as to perform simple day-to-day database maintenance.
